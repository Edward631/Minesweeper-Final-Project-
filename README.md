# Minesweeper-Final-Project-
This repository contains a Minesweeper project. 
Hello I am Edward Medeiros and this is my minesweeper game. We were tasked with creating an application using java and i chose minesweeper. This minesweeper game has the same ruels as minesweeper were you are tasked with finding the bombs based on the information from the spaces. I will add to the minesweeper game a level selector, a varity of themes (color and shapes) that the player can change, a timer, a leaderboard, and overall improving the orginal ai code.
